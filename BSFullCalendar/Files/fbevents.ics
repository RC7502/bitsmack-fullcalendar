LOCATION:Wolf's Ridge Brewing
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/319488235166667/
DESCRIPTION:We told you it was going to be a s
 ummer for sours\, Columbus\, and we'
 re keeping that promise with 2 new
  entries into our Wild Heritage Se
 ries:  Terre du Sauvage Green and 
 Terre du Sauvage Red! Both are tra
 ditional\, barrel-aged wild beers t
 hat natrually fermented in oak for
  over a year.\n\nTerre du Sauvage Gr
 een\, Batch #1 ($12.99/22 oz):\nA ne
 w take on our traditional farmhous
 e saison.  The grain bill was mode
 led after L'Abondance but fermente
 d with brett and saison yeast and 
 aged in second-use bourbon barrels
 .  Terre du Sauvage Green was blen
 ded with Terre du Sauvage Gold bar
 rels for acidity\, and dry hopped w
 ith Ekuanot.  This beer is balance
 d\, bright and refreshing-we'd like
  to think it's a great gateway bre
 w for people who think they don't 
 enjoy wild\, sour beers!\n\nTerre du 
 Sauvage Red\, Batch #1 ($12.99/22 o
 z): \nThis version of our farmhouse
  saison was brewed with 40% rye. W
 e fermented it with brett\, lacto\, 
 and hefe yeast\, and then aged it i
 n bourbon barrels for 16 months. \n
 \nDire Wolf Coco Joy ($12.99/22 oz)
 :\nThe first infusion with Dire Wol
 f was Coco Joy\, and it's also prov
 en to be one of the most elusive. 
 This wonderful and bold beer has q
 uietly waited in the shadows until
  now. Dire Wolf offers a rich brea
 dy base with notes of coffee\, brow
 n sugar\, and dark chocolate with a
  healthy dose of American and Engl
 ish hops for balance. We then add 
 an ungodly amount of hand-toasted 
 coconut\, cacao nibs\, and vanilla b
 ean. Savor young for fresh coconut
  flavor\; or age for a more nuanced
 \, vanilla-forward beer.\n\nAll of th
 ese brews will be available in 22 
 oz bombers out of our tap room dur
 ing this all-day release party. Do
 ors open at 10:00 am for drafts an
 d food\, and the bottle sale starts
  at 11:00 am (first come\, first se
 rve as always). Expect a unique dr
 aft list with new brews and specia
 l casks! Think you don't like sour
 s?? Stop by during the party to tr
 y some our our traditional\, wild b
 eers on draft and find out!\n\nStay
